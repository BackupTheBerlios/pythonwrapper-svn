Todo list:
- Wrap stack trace objects since they are such a pain to deal with.
- Update PythonException class to log a nice python stack trace.
- Possibly wrap Type objects.
- Make an ignore attribute in TypeManager so that a user may specify certain
  types to ignore.
- Create a configuration file format and write a parser for it.  It should
  contain:
  * [ModuleName]                - header
  * library = path_to_library   - the actual dll/so to load
  * import = none|all           - default export status for items
  * exclude = classA|classB|... - items to exclude from import all
  * include = classA|classB|... - items to include from import none
